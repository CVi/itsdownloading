# itsdownloading
Bulk downloading of course files from itslearning for NTNU students before the switch to blackboard.
Can download any of your favorite courses. Make sure that the course is starred/marked as favorite
if it is not one of the available courses in the downloader.

## Run from source
You can run the script directly using python 3.6 (or later) and the libraries listed in requirements.txt
(use pip install -r requirements.txt to install them using pip).

## Run from standalone executable
Since python can be a bit of a pain to set up on windows, i have created an executable for Windows
[here](http://simennj.com/itsdownloading.exe).
